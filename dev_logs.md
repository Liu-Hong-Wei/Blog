# development logs

## 1. add basic frontend and backend functions

added several mouths ago

## 2. set up Chevereto image hosting

Choosing to use docker to set up Chevereto, then dockerized frontend and backend, add nginx-proxy to take over the requests redirection

## 3. optimize the docker deployment experiences

- configure CI/CD using GitHub Actions (not perfect yet)
    - and it takes a little bit longer to connect VPS with SSH
    - it caused by port mapping while VPS SSH port is customized but GitHub Actions'port is using the default. (actually it's stupid)
- add configuration setting example to README.md file in case to forget how to initial docker setup
- frontend's nginx didn't works as expect, it turn out that the conf file is not copied into docker conf to override it.

## 4. prune backend code, add React Suspense and fix django admin panel issues

- simplified backend code by removing redundant code
- implemented lazy loading and data fetching with React Suspense
    - Example: 
    ```jsx
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}> <LazyLoadedComponent /> </Suspense>
    ```
- implemented code splitting in the frontend by Route-based Splitting and Bundle Splitting

## fix frontend route to django admin panel issue

- complete the `.env` file rules when it's using in [docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/)
- create static files's volume which is generated by `collectstatic` for sharing between frontend and backend docker container in production environment (when DEBUG=False, Django would not provide static files itself)
