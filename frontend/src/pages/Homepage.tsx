            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
            the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
            of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
            picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
            close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did
            Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
            itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit
            actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it
            and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed
            across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
            a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with
            curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to
            see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In another
            moment, down went Alice after it! [Illustration] The rabbit-hole
            went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly
            down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about
            stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
            to be a very deep well.
            <img

            />
            Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
            plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she
            tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see
            anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that
            they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she
            saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one
            of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE,"
            but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to
            drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
            fell past it. Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end?
            There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to
            herself. "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
            (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
            tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!" Alice
            felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she
            came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
            Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked
            up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
            passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
            There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and
            was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh, my ears
            and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when
            she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen. She
            found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
            lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall,
            but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down
            one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down
            the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly
            she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was
            nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that
            this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either
            the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any
            rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time
            'round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
            behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the
            little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!
            [Illustration] Alice opened the door and found that it led into a
            small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and
            looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How
            she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those
            beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not
            even get her head through the doorway. "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish
            I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew
            how to begin." Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might
            find another key on it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting
            people up like telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it
            ("which certainly was not here before," said Alice), and tied 'round
            the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME"
            beautifully printed on it in large letters.
